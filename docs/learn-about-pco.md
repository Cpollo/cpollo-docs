Explanation of a PCO (Parallel Coin Offering)

Project X
Total supply: 30 bilion tokens
20 bilion of those 30 bilion going live for trading on the first of January
The PCO (Parallel Coin Offering) starts on the first of January aswell, for a period of 3 months. 

In that PCO, the part that’s left of 10 bilion tokens will be sold directly OTC (over the counter). The price of the tokens in the PCO is a static price for the period of 3 months. 

Because trading is already going on, the price of the token might rise above the PCO price. Because of that, people will be triggered to buy tokens OTC from the PCO. Only thing is, the tokens bought in the PCO cannot be traded for the 3 months that the PCO is live. After those 3 months, there will be a 4 months period with 25% of the PCO bought tokens released every month. This is to prevent any huge dumps on the market.

The money raised with the PCO is via direct sells so the team doesn’t need to sell tokens on the market to raise money. That way, the price will not be influenced in a negative way.

There will be no hard or softcap so the money that’s raised by PCO can be used by the team directly after transaction.

People will be able to buy the tokens for a price lower than the market value, this will push them to buy from the PCO and that’s positive for the team because they raise money to develop the project.
