title: Cpollo ERC20 Token Templates
---

Cpollo will use three type of ERC20 token templates with three mixed behaviours:

- Type1: Burnable 
- Type2: Burnable and Mintable
- Type3: Burnable, Mintable and Capped

The Burnable behavior enables user holders to burn tokens, the Mintable behavior enables the token owner to mint new tokens, and the Capped Behavior limits the amount of tokens that a Mintable token can create.


These tokens can be created directly in the platform, and any user can create tokens, however only legit tokens will be accepted to be listed in the platform. The tokens will be listed in the platform if the associated projects pass the Cpollo Vetting process and Cpollo will charge in Cpollo tokens to create these templates.
